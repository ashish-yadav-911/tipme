## Original User Request:
Build a Tipping Calculator Android App using React Native to help users quickly calculate the tip on a restaurant bill, and optionally split the total amount among friends. The app should have a clean and elegant UI using a white and purple color scheme. The application will support user authentication with login and logout functionalities, saving user preferences for tip percentage and previous bill history using AsyncStorage (or Firebase Firestore for cloud sync, optional). The app should be production-ready with modular and scalable code.

Add input validations to prevent empty or zero values.

Use React Native's Appearance API to toggle dark/light modes (optional).
